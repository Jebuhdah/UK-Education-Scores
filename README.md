# UK-Education-Scores
This report uses data from http://www.bristol.ac.uk that records chemistry test scores from 2,200 
schools in the United Kingdom for 31,000 students. This analytic will examine the important factors that 
causes variations in the GCSE scores, with a hypothesis that students who are born near the end of a 
calendar year, are a few months older than those born at the start at the calendar year, and should have 
a slight advantage as being older and mature, thus should achieve a higher grade.
